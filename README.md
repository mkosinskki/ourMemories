## 📚 Project description

A project created with the intention of learning programming as a fullstack developer (node ​​+ express + vue + tailwind + mongoDB) and creating a small gift for my girlfriend, so that we could browse our memories and save them not only in the gallery 💗. 


The project involves creating a website with user registration and login, but currently it does not intend to make the servers available to external users.The application will include a page with a map where you can view the locations where memories were added, and a page with memories that can be filtered and sorted using: the date the memory was added, the actual date of the event, and the location. The Memories page will contain several individual "posts" with a short name/location. Clicking on a post will display a popup with details about that Memories. Additionally, the application will include a panel allowing you to add new memories and a user profile page.
